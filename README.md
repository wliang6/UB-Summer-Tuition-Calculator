UB Summer Tuition Calculator
A simple calculator to compute the estimated cost of an undergraduate student's summer tuition in the year of 2015-2016. Personal practice and to familiarize myself with the MVC pattern.


 * The purpose of this small summer tuition calculator is to implement 
 * the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. 
 * Model - transitioning the data to object classes and making a UML diagram to show the design of the UI
 * View - what the user visualizes; particularly the user interface (UI)
 * Controller - the code and logic behind the program; links the model and the view together
 * 
 * The interface allows a typical undergraduate student from University at Buffalo
 * to input their name, resident status, and # credits they are taking. 
 * The estimated cost is then displayed to them on the interface.
 * 

The driver is located in the UInterface.java file.
